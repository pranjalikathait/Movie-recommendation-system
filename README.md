**Case Study ML Netflix Movie Recommendation System**

A Machine Learning Case Study for a Movie Recommendation System Using Collaborative and Content-Based Filtering.

**Business Statement**

Netflix is all about connecting people with the films they enjoy. To assist customers in finding those films, they created CinematchSM, a world-class movie recommendation system. Its duty is to anticipate whether a person would appreciate a movie based on how much they loved or disliked previous films. Netflix uses these predictions to provide personalised movie suggestions based on each customer's specific preferences. And, while Cinematch is performing reasonably well, it can always be improved. There are several interesting alternate ideas to how Cinematch works that Netflix has yet to try. Some are described in the literature; others are not. We're intrigued if any of these can outperform Cinematch by producing superior predictions. Because, really, if there is a better way, it might make a significant impact for our consumers and business.

**Problem Statement**

Netflix has released a significant dataset of anonymous movie evaluations, along with a challenge to improve the efficacy of its current recommendation algorithm, CinematchSM. The benchmark for improvement is a prediction accuracy bar that outperforms Cinematch by at least 10% on the same training dataset. Accuracy is defined as the degree to which predicted movie ratings match actual ratings. The goal is to create a unique recommendation system capable of exceeding Cinematch while improving the overall quality of movie predictions for customers. This challenge supports the development of unique ways in recommendation systems in order to achieve greater forecast accuracy and, as a result, improve the user experience on the Netflix platform.
